# Drumming-EEG-Expt-Psychopy
This repository contains the code for the drumming experiment whereby we correlate drum rhythms with eeg signals and enjoyment levels.

Here, we have used Lab Streaming Layer(LSL) inside code snippets of the psychopy builder mode. 

We present drumbeat stimuli and send the associated event markers with LSL.
